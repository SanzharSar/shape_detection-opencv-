## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to detect simple geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles in images using OpenCV. By learning how to detect these shapes, you'll gain a better understanding of how to apply computer vision techniques to real-world problems.

## Features

- **Shape Detection:** Identifies basic geometric shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.
- **Annotation:** Draws the detected shapes on the original image for easy visualization.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** The code is simple and easy to understand, making it perfect for those new to OpenCV and computer vision.

## Acknowledgements
